# About

This repository contains the Y Algorithm described in the paper about the "Union Closed Sets" as defined by Ηρακλής Χαλκίδης in C++.

NOTE: This is not an optimized version but the algorithm described on the paper translated to code, as it would otherwise defeat the purposes of this project. An optimized version may be released too if we (or you) deem it necessary.
